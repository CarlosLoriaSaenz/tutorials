# Hexagonal Architecture in Java.
## Goal
This is a simple demo for illustrating the main concepts of an [hexagonal architecture](wiki_hex) in Java.
## Approach
We follow a quite minimalistic approach focusing only on basic concepts. Accordingly and for the sake of simplicity, we do not use any particular framework. We just simulate an hypothetical container that would enforce and execute an application modeled under the hexagonal architecture. The container is just a set of custom annotations to decorate the assets and separate the source code according to the type of asset: port, adapter and core.
